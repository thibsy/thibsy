# Hello there, nice to meet you!

I'm currently working as a junior software developer at [sr solutions ag](https://github.com/srsolutionsag), where I develop all sorts of things around [ILIAS](https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS).

## Some of my interests are ...

- 💻 Programming (obviously)
- 🍜 Cooking (and eating it too)
- 🎮 Board- & strategy games
